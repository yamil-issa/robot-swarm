# Space Exploration Swarm - Rust Project

## Overview
This project implements a **swarm of autonomous robots** for **space exploration and astrobiological research**. The robots collaborate to explore planetary surfaces, collect data on geology, chemistry, and potential signs of life.

## Features
- **Procedural Map Generation**: The terrain is generated using **Perlin Noise**.
- **ASCII Map Rendering**: The simulation is displayed in the terminal.
- **Modular Design**: Components include a map system, robots, and a station.
- **Resource Management**: The map includes collectible resources like **energy, minerals, and scientific points of interest**.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Robots specialize in different tasks like exploration, mining, and scientific analysis.
